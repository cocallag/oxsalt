<p>We have a range of research projects. Our focus is on identifying new pathways in atherosclerotic disease, particularly in inflammatory aspects of the disease. <br />
This often involves studies of gene regulation and as part of this we have developed a technology for the assembly of large DNA fragments.</p>
