<section id="how-to-implement-the-oxsalt-intervention"><h2>How to implement the OxSalt intervention</h2>
<p>If having reviewed the above <a class="reference external" href="https://journals.lww.com/kidney360/fulltext/2023/07000/evaluation_of_a_simple_low_cost_intervention_to.5.aspx">publication</a> you are interested in implementing the OxSalt care bundle or modifying it to suit your local requirements, then the information and files on this website should help you to do this. You can view and download components and details of the intervention by clicking on the Files tab above or on this <a class="reference external" href="../files/">link</a> . <br></p>
<p>The intervention is simple and cheap to implement. If helpful, please feel free to use the resources of this website and the website itself in implementing the intervention. <strong>If we can help in any way, please do get in touch and we would be delighted to hear about your experiences with the intervention.</strong></p>
<p>The first <a class="reference external" href="../documents/001_overview.pdf">file</a> provides an overview of the intervention.</p>
<section id="presentation"><h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>At the start of the intervention, participants were provided with a set of brief self-explanatory slides to look over on an iPad or laptop PC; the slides present key
points and provide some relevant examples. The basic presentation is available as a simple <a class="reference external" href="../documents/003_presentation.pdf">pdf file</a> which can be viewed on most devices. The presentation is also available as a <a class="reference external" href="../documents/003a_presentation_with_audio.pptx">Powerpoint file with a narrated soundtrack</a>. If you want to record your own soundtrack, the basic <a class="reference external" href="../documents/002_script.pdf">script for the presentation</a> is also available.</p>
</section><section id="printed-material"><h3>Printed Material</h3>
<p>Participants were also provided with the following printed material.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An <a class="reference external" href="../documents/004_salt_Information_booklet.pdf">introductory booklet</a> about the benefits of reducing salt intake, how to evaluate the salt content of foods and how to select or prepare appetising food that is low in salt content.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a class="reference external" href="../documents/007_small_reminder_card.pdf">small credit card-sized reminder card</a> about food labelling and the salt content of food.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a class="reference external" href="../documents/005_salt_content_booklet.pdf">booklet</a> containing information about the salt content of common foods, grouped together to help guide decision-making for different meals (e.g. breakfast, lunch etc.) or snacks.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a class="reference external" href="../documents/006_shopping_guide_and_portion_table.pdf">single page shopping guide</a>  summarizing the salt contents of key common foods and grouping them into high, medium, and low salt categories to assist and simplify shopping decision-making. This is a 2-sided document that could be folded and carried for use when shopping. On one side is a shopping guide that indicates red, amber and green choices. On the other side is a table showing how much salt would be in a portion of a particular size.</p></li>
<li><p>An information sheet with <a class="reference external" href="../documents/008_seasoning_recipes_and_eating_out_tips.pdf">tips for eating-out</a> to help decision-making around the salt content of foods ordered from a menu.</p></li>
<li><p>An information sheet with <a class="reference external" href="../documents/008_seasoning_recipes_and_eating_out_tips.pdf">suggestions for salt-free seasoning</a>  for home-cooking. This is on the second page of the tips for eating out information document, so both pages can be printed on each side of a single sheet of paper.</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="oxsalt-website"><h3>OxSalt Website</h3>
<p>In addition to the printed material, participants had access to a website containing online versions of the information and guidance that had been provided in the written material. The original website is no longer operational, but you can review <a class="reference external" href="../documents/010_original_website_snapshots.pdf">screenshots of this original OxSalt site</a>. The key features of the original website have been recreated on this website and the current URL is <a class="reference external" href="https://cocallag.github.io/oxsalt">https://cocallag.github.io/oxsalt</a> . The current website can be viewed easily on most devices including phones and people using the site should be encouraged to click sequentially on the Home, Start, Why, Checking, How To, and then Files tabs.</p>
<p>The website also provided electronic downloadable versions of the printed material that was provided as well as a downloadable <a class="reference external" href="../documents/009_shopping_list.pdf">shopping list</a> and <a class="reference external" href="../documents/011_food_diary.pdf">food diary</a>.</p>
</section><section id="communications"><h3>Communications</h3>
<p>During the course of the 4-week intervention, participants receive a series of automated emails and text messages reminding them about different aspects of the information that they had already been provided with. Topics in these communications included, for example, motivational messages about the benefits of reducing salt intake, about making decisions about food purchasing and consumption that include consideration of salt content and tips for healthy food choices.
The <a class="reference external" href="../documents/012_communications_schedule.pdf">communication schedule</a> for these emails and for the SMS text messages lists the timing and the ID number of each communication. The <a class="reference external" href="../documents/013_communications_content.pdf">content of each communication</a> is provided in a separate file in which the communications are listed in order with their numerical ID. The communications were all sent by automated services.</p>
