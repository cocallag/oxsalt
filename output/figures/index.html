<p>Salt can raise blood pressure leading to strokes and heart disease. Lowering salt intake lowers blood pressure and so reduces the risk of stroke and heart disease.
For people with kidney disease, lowering salt intake can slow the deterioration in kidney function.</p>
<aside class="topic"><p class="topic-title">Remember</p>
<p>Food does not need to have any salt added to it either during cooking or when eaten.</p>
</aside><section id="blood-pressure"><h2>Blood Pressure</h2>
<p>There is very good evidence that salt can make your blood pressure higher. High blood pressure has many bad effects. It makes it more likely that you will have a stroke, a heart attack and develop kidney failure. High blood pressure can also damage other blood vessels including those in your eyes.
If you already have high blood pressure and are on treatment for it, then lowering your salt intake can help to reduce the amount of medication that you need to control your blood pressure.

<p>High salt intake can make kidney function deteriorate more quickly than it would otherwise. This means that for people with chronic kidney disease(CKD), lowering salt intake can help to keep the kidneys working well for longer.
This is partly because salt raises blood pressure and high blood pressure can damage kidneys. However, the kidney is the organ that removes salt from the body and a high salt intake seems likely to have a direct effect on kidney function.
If you have advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), then your kidneys may find it difficult to get rid of the salt that you eat. If this salt accumulates, then water will accumulate with it in your body. This causes fluid retention or swelling especially of your ankles. It can also cause your blood pressure to rise.
If you have CKD you may be given a diuretic (a ‘water tablet’) to help your kidneys to remove the salt from your body. By helping your kidneys to remove the salt, it helps remove the water with it. As a result you may notice that you pass more urine than normal after taking the tablet. Commonly used diuretics are furosemide (previously called frusemide), bumetanide and bendroflumethiazide previously bendrofluazide).
If your kidneys  are struggling to eliminate the salt that you are eating, then it makes sense to try to reduce the amount of salt that you are eating and so make it easier for your kidneys to do their job.

<p>Welcome to the ox salt website. This site is designed to help you to reduce the amount of salt you eat.
There is lots of information and tools to help you reduce the amount of salt in your diet.
The key steps are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>understand why we need to reduce our salt intake</p></li>
<li><p>Know how much salt you eat</p></li>
<li><p>Know how to make healthier choices</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of useful links that will help you guide you in reducing your salt intake and you might want to have a look at some of them here</p>
