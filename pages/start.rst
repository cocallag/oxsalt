Salt was introduced into our diet to preserve food before refrigerators and freezers were available. However, it is not good for our health and there is real benefit from lowering the salt content of the food we eat. Some foods have a high percentage of salt in them and these foods are best avoided or eaten only occasinoally and in small quantities.
