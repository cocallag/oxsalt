How to implement the OxSalt intervention
=============================================

You can view and download components and details of the intervention by clicking on the Files tab above or on this `link </files/>`_ . |br|

The intervention is simple and cheap to implement. If helpful, please feel free to use the resources of this website and the website itself in implementing the intervention. **If we can help in any way, please do get in touch and we would be delighted to hear about your experiences with the intervention.** 

The first `file </documents/001_overview.pdf>`_ provides an overview of the intervention. 

Presentation
--------------

At the start of the intervention, participants were provided with a set of brief self-explanatory slides to look over on an iPad or laptop PC; the slides present key 
points and provide some relevant examples. The basic presentation is available as a simple `pdf file </documents/003_presentation.pdf>`_ which can be viewed on most devices. The presentation is also available as a `Powerpoint file with a narrated soundtrack </documents/003a_presentation_with_audio.pptx>`_. If you want to record your own soundtrack, the basic `script for the presentation </documents/002_script.pdf>`_ is also available. 


Printed Material
-------------------

Participants were also provided with the following printed material. 

* An `introductory booklet </documents/004_salt_Information_booklet.pdf>`_ about the benefits of reducing salt intake, how to evaluate the salt content of foods and how to select or prepare appetising food that is low in salt content. 
* A `small credit card-sized reminder card </documents/007_small_reminder_card.pdf>`_ about food labelling and the salt content of food. 
* A `booklet </documents/005_salt_content_booklet.pdf>`_ containing information about the salt content of common foods, grouped together to help guide decision-making for different meals (e.g. breakfast, lunch etc.) or snacks. 
* A `single page shopping guide </documents/006_shopping_guide_and_portion_table.pdf>`_  summarizing the salt contents of key common foods and grouping them into high, medium, and low salt categories to assist and simplify shopping decision-making. This is a 2-sided document that could be folded and carried for use when shopping. On one side is a shopping guide that indicates red, amber and green choices. On the other side is a table showing how much salt would be in a portion of a particular size.
* An information sheet with `tips for eating-out </documents/008_seasoning_recipes_and_eating_out_tips.pdf>`_ to help decision-making around the salt content of foods ordered from a menu. 
* An information sheet with `suggestions for salt-free seasoning </documents/008_seasoning_recipes_and_eating_out_tips.pdf>`_  for home-cooking. This is on the second page of the tips for eating out information document, so both pages can be printed on each side of a single sheet of paper. 


OxSalt Website
-----------------

In addition to the printed material, participants had access to a website containing online versions of the information and guidance that had been provided in the written material. The original website is no longer operational, but you can review `screenshots of this original OxSalt site </documents/010_original_website_snapshots.pdf>`_. The key features of the original website have been recreated on this website and the current URL is https://cocallag.github.io/oxsalt . The current website can be viewed easily on most devices including phones and people using the site should be encouraged to click sequentially on the Home, Start, Why, Checking, How To, and then Files tabs. 

The website also provided electronic downloadable versions of the printed material that was provided as well as a downloadable `shopping list </documents/009_shopping_list.pdf>`_ and `food diary </documents/011_food_diary.pdf>`_.
    
Communications
---------------

During the course of the 4-week intervention, participants receive a series of automated emails and text messages reminding them about different aspects of the information that they had already been provided with. Topics in these communications included, for example, motivational messages about the benefits of reducing salt intake, about making decisions about food purchasing and consumption that include consideration of salt content and tips for healthy food choices. 
The `communication schedule </documents/012_communications_schedule.pdf>`_ for these emails and for the SMS text messages lists the timing and the ID number of each communication. The `content of each communication </documents/013_communications_content.pdf>`_ is provided in a separate file in which the communications are listed in order with their numerical ID. The communications were all sent by automated services.
